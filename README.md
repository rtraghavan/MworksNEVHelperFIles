**Overview**
---
This repository contains a core set of matlab functions used to align **.mwk** files to simultaneously acquired .**nev** files in Movshon Lab.

**.mwk** files are generated by [MWorks](https://mworks.github.io/), a stimulus control and display program. 
**.nev** files are neural recording files generated by [Blackrock Microsystems](http://blackrockmicro.com/) hardware.

**Contents**
---
getmworksinfo.m : a function that uses mworks matlab tools (installed with software) to extract information from mworks *.mwk* files
mworks2nevconversion.m: a function that uses MWORKS matlab tools, blackrock microsystems [NPMK](https://github.com/BlackrockMicrosystems/NPMK/tree/master/NPMK) software and getmworksinfo.m to get a scaling factor that can align stimulus display times to times recorded using nev.
